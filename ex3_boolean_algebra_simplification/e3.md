8. Consider the following logic circuit:
  F(A, B, C, D) =  A’B’C + AB’C + ABC’D + ABCD’

draw the logic circuit for the function using only NAND gates.

draw the logic circuit for the function using only NOR gates.

design a two-bit ALU that perform the following operations on two 2-bit numbers (A1A0 and B1B0) based on the values of the two control inputs S1 and S0.
The operations are:
00: A + B (2-bit binary addition)
01: A - B (2-bit binary subtraction)
10: A AND B
11: A OR B
