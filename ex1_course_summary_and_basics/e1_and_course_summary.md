## Course Summary

- Information exchanges between two electrical systems is in the form of digital or analog signals
- Modern computers work with digital signals
- A digital signal is represented by two voltages
- Binary is the representation of a number in base-2
- The frequency of a signal is the inverse of its cycle time

One digit in binary is called a bit, 8 bits is called one byte and 4 bytes is called one word
Information is represented inside the computer by binary or Base-2.
Negative numbers inside the computer is represented by the two’s complement
The most significant bit in signed numbers is represented by the sign of the number.
Positive is represented by zero and negative is represented by one.

One’s complement of a binary number is the complement of each bit of the number
Two’s complement of a binary number is the complement of the number plus one
Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) is used for representing decimal numbers from 0 to 9 
The hexadecimal number system is used in digital systems and computers as an efficient way of representing binary quantities
Parity bit is used for error detection of one bit error

IEEE 757 standard is used to represent floating point number  
Information is represented by ASCII Code inside the computer; ASCII code is made of 7 bits.
Information between components of a computer can be transmitted in serial or parallel form
In serial transmission, information is transmitted one bit at a time 
In parallel transmission information transmitted in multiple bits at a time. 
The next chapter will cover Boolean logic, Boolean Algebra theorems and logic gates. Logic gate is the basic component of an Integrated circuit (IC)
